## Asymptotic Notation

Gained a deep understanding of asymptotic notation including Big O, Big Theta, and Big Omega, and how they are used to describe the efficiency of algorithms.

## Insertion Sort

This section covers the basics of the Insertion Sort algorithm, its implementation, and its time complexity analysis.

## Merge Sort

Learned the divide-and-conquer approach of Merge Sort, its implementation, and how it achieves a time complexity of O(n log n).

## Heap Sort

Learned about the Heap Sort algorithm, its implementation using a binary heap, and its time complexity.

## Recursion Using Trees

Learned about the use of recursion in algorithm design, particularly using tree structures, and how to analyze the performance of recursive algorithms.

## Substitution Method

Mastered the substitution method for solving recurrence relations and applying it to analyze the time complexity of recursive algorithms.

## Master Theorem

Understood the Master Theorem and how it provides a straightforward way to solve recurrences of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Counting Sort

Explored the linear-time Counting Sort algorithm and its applications, including its limitations and when it is most effectively used.

## Radix Sort

Studied the non-comparative Radix Sort algorithm and how it extends Count Sort to sort integers in linear time.

## Quick Sort

Studied the Quick Sort algorithm, its partitioning approach, average-case time complexity, and practical performance considerations.

## Dynamic Programming

Explored the principles of dynamic programming, including memoization and tabulation, and how to solve problems that exhibit optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.

## Greedy Algorithms

Understood the greedy algorithmic paradigm and its applications, along with examples where greedy approaches yield optimal solutions.

## Knapsack Problem

Examined the Knapsack Problem, a classic example of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms, and various approaches to solve it.

## Huffman Coding

Learned about Huffman Coding for data compression, its implementation, and how it uses a greedy approach to build an optimal prefix code.

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Studied the Bellman-Ford algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs with negative weights, and its comparison with Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Difference Constraints

Explored difference constraints and their applications in solving systems of linear inequalities using shortest path algorithms.

## Flow Networks Using Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm

Understood the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for computing maximum flow in flow networks, including the concept of residual graphs and augmenting paths.
